                        <p>With its user-friendly setup process, the Galaxy S20 FE made it simple to get going with a
                            new gadget. Clear and simple instructions were provided in the handbook that came with the
                            product, and if more help was required, extensive internet resources are always available.

                            interface's user-friendly design, customizing everything from UI color schemes to app
                            permissions for microphone and camera access was simple and painless. With the Galaxy S20
                            FE, I could customize its look to suit my preferences, be they bold or subdued, and the
                            gadget would always represent my individual style and priorities.</p>

                        <p>The sensor is a different kind too - this one is optical, while the non-FEs get ultrasonic
                            ones. It still doesn't give you that instant unlock feeling that you can get from a OnePlus,
                            for example, and it takes an extra split second to get you to the homescreen. It is,
                            however, more reliable than the ultrasonic ones - we had fewer failed attempts on this one
                            that we normally get with the S20s.

                        <p>Not really sure whats happening but lately my fingerprint scanner sometimes doesn't wanna
                            work from the AOD.
                            its random but sometimes when i try to scan my print the screen dims and it won't scan. Just
                            keeps saying to press longer. Even if i hold my finger there. How can i fix this?

                        <p>The Galaxy S20 FE can handle most casual games without any problems. It has a powerful
                            processor and a smooth display, and the controls are responsive.</p>
                        <h3>Social Media:</h3>
                        <p>The Galaxy S20 FE has all of the social media apps that you need, such as Facebook,
                            Instagram, and Twitter. The apps are all optimized for the Galaxy S20 FE, so they run
                            smoothly and quickly.</p>

                        <h2>Some Limitations and Drawbacks</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Overheating: The Galaxy S20 FE can sometimes get a bit hot when gaming or video editing.
                                This is because these tasks are very demanding and require a lot of processing power.
                                However, the phone has a built-in cooling system that helps to keep it cool, and it
                                should not overheat to the point of being dangerous. </li>
                            <li>Software bugs: The Galaxy S20 FE's software is still under development, and there may be
                                some bugs that can cause the phone to crash or malfunction. However, Samsung is
                                regularly releasing software updates that fix these bugs, so you should experience fewer
                                problems over time. </li>
                            <li>Slow fingerprint sensor: The Galaxy S20 FE's in-display fingerprint sensor is a bit
                                slower than some other fingerprint sensors on the market. This means that it may take a
                                little longer to unlock your phone using your fingerprint. However, the sensor is still
                                accurate and reliable, and it should not be a major problem. </li>
                            <li>Nighttime photography: The Galaxy S20 FE's camera system does not perform as well in low
                                light as some other flagship smartphones. This means that your photos may not be as
                                clear or sharp in low-light conditions. However, the camera system is still capable of
                                taking high-quality photos in a variety of lighting conditions. </li>

                        <p>My customer support experience with the Galaxy S20 FE was far from satisfactory. Dealing with
                            chatbots, long wait times, and poorly organized online resources made the process
                            unnecessarily
                            tedious and frustrating. I hope Samsung improves its customer support to prevent similar
                            experiences for other users.</p>

                        <h2>Is it Worth it..??</h2>
                        <p>Absolutely. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE offers excellent value for its price, particularly
                            during
                            Cyber Week promotions. It is a powerful and versatile phone that can handle a variety of
                            tasks,
                            including photography, gaming, and web browsing. It has a long-lasting battery, a great
                            camera
                            system, and a beautiful display. While it may not be the most affordable phone on the
                            market, it
                            is well worth the price for its features and performance.Specially, around this year it will
                            be
                            availabile under 300 CAD, that makes a no brainer.
